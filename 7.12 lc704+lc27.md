# lc.704 Binary Search   
**Problem**  
Given: an integer array, in ascending order, an integer target   
Return: if the target exists in the array, return its index, return -1 otherwise (must use O(logn) time)

## My solution [left, right]   
Using two pointers.  
Because the nums array is in ascending order, we can first find the middle number and compare it with the target value.     
If the middle number is larger than the target, we continue searching for the target in the numbers before the middle number.     
If it is smaller, we search in the numbers after the middle number.     
We repeat this process until we find the target, returning -1 if it is not found.    
```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            print(nums[mid])
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid+1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid-1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1

```

## Another solution [left, right)   
Same logic as the first one.   
But here the valid range for searching is [left, right), when nums[mid] > target, we should search on the left side and update the value of right to mid.   
```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1

```

**Time Complexity**  
O(logn)   
**Space complexity**   
O(1)   


# lc.27  Remove elements   
## My solution
First step:    
Using two pointers (slow and fast) and iterating through the nums list to check if the slow num is equal to the target value. 
If it is, then swap it with the fast num.
The aim of doing this is to move all the target values to the end of the nums list.

Second step:    
Iterating over the reversed nums list and removing the target value from the beginning of the list. Finally, return the length of the nums.

```
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int: 
        slow = 0
        fast = 1
        n = len(nums)-1

        while slow < fast and fast <= n:
            if nums[slow] == val:
                cur = nums[slow] # use a reference to keep the original value of nums[slow]
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                nums[fast] = cur
            slow += 1
            fast += 1

        for num in reversed(nums): # iterate in a reversed direction to remove the target value
            if num == val:
                nums.remove(num)
        
        return len(nums)
```


**Time and space complexity**    
Time: O(n), iterate over the nums list, of which the length is n    
Space: O(1), remove the elements in place
