### Lc.977 Squares of a Sorted Array   
#### My Solution    
Calculate the square value of each element, then sort the list. The time complexity is O(nlogn).   
```
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []

        for num in nums:
            new_num = num * num
            res.append(new_num)

        res.sort()
        return res
```

#### Two pointers    
Using two pointers to compare values, and initialize an empty array and a pointer k.
Compare nums[left]**2 and nums[right]**2, and add the larger one into the new array first, so that we don't need to use any sorting method.
```
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0 for _ in range(len(nums))]

        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        k = len(nums)-1

        while left <= right:
            num_l = nums[left] ** 2
            num_r = nums[right] ** 2
            if num_l <= num_r:
                res[k] = num_r
                k -= 1
                right -= 1
            else:
                res[k] = num_l
                k -= 1
                left += 1
        return res
```

### lc.209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum   
#### Problem      
Given: an array of positive integers nums, and a positive integer target   
Return: minimal length o f the subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target, return 0 otherwise   

#### My solution      
Using sliding window.   
Initialize two pointers, i and j. when the sum of nums[i:j+1] >= target, calculate the length of the subarray and keep the minimum one. Move i and j to the next position and re-calculate the sum.      
when the sum of nums[i:j] < target, move j to the next index and add nums[j] into the current sum until the sum is larger than or equal to the target.
```
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        length = float('inf')

        i = 0
        j = 0
        cur = 0
        while i <= j and j < len(nums):
            cur = sum(nums[i:j+1])
            if cur >= target:
                length = min((j+1-i), length)
                cur = 0
                i += 1
                j = i
            elif cur < target:
                j += 1
            
        if length == float('inf'):
            return 0
        else:
            return length
```   
This method is too slow. The time complexity is O(n^3).     
1. The outer loop runs from i = 0 to i = len(nums) - 1. This loop contributes O(n) time complexity.   
2. The inner loop runs from j = 0 to j = len(nums) - 1 for each i value, resulting in a total of O(n^2) time complexity.    
3. Within the inner loop, the sum(nums[i:j+1]) operation computes the sum of a subarray. This operation takes at most O(n) time complexity.      

Overall, the time complexity is O(n) * O(n) * O(n) = O(n^3), which can be very inefficient for larger input sizes.   
The main problem is we have to recalculate the sum of the subarray in each iteration.   

#### Improvement      
We still create a window in this method, which is nums[i:j+1].      
However, now we keep tracking the sum of the subarray and don't have to calculate it in each iteration.     
When the sum is greater than the target, we remove the left side of the window, which is nums[i], and move i and j to the next position.      
Otherwise, we keep moving j until the sum is greater than or equal to the target.     

```
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        length = float('inf')
        cur_sum = 0
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            cur_sum += nums[j]
            while cur_sum >= target:
                length = min(length, j - i + 1)
                cur_sum -= nums[i]
                i += 1
        
        if length == float('inf'):
            return 0
        else:
            return length
```

### lc.59 Spiral Matrix II    
Given: a positive integer n   
Return: an n*n matrix filled with 1 to n^2   

#### Simulation   
Fill the matrix in four directions: left to right, top to bottom, right to left, and bottom to top. Just simulate it in spiral order.
```
class Solution:
    def generateMatrix(self, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        top = 0
        bottom = n-1
        left = 0
        right = n-1
        num = 1
        target = n*n
        
        while num <= target:
            # left to right
            for i in range(left, right+1):
                nums[top][i] = num
                num += 1    
            top += 1
            # top to bottom
            for j in range(top, bottom+1):
                nums[j][right] = num
                num += 1
            right -= 1
            # right to left
            for m in range(right, left-1, -1):
                nums[bottom][m] = num
                num += 1
            bottom -= 1
            # bottom to top
            for n in range(bottom, top-1, -1):
                nums[n][left] = num
                num += 1
            left += 1
        return nums
```
